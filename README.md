# Dice Rolls Simulation

## Introduction
This exercise simulates the rolling of 1 or more dice. It compares the simulation to the theoretical likelihood of each dice face appearing.

- This is a console application that allows integer inputs for the number of dice (1 - 16) and the number of rolls.
- The programs counts the number of times each dice lands on one of the faces.
- The simulation illustrates the law of large numbers. The larger the number of dice rolls, the closer the sum of simulated dice rolls mimic the theoretical likelihood of each dice face.
